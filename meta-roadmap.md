# Blueprint Meta-Roadmap

## Project Vision
Minimalist, vendor-agnostic, drop-in instruction files to transform any project into a structured research workflow for both AI assistants and human collaborators.

## Core Objectives
- **Provide coding agents and LLMs with guidelines for structured project flows**
- Provide drop-in instruction files for any project
- Transform coding assistants into research assistants
- Establish structured research documentation methodology
- Enable systematic journal management
- Support interactive roadmap refinement
- Facilitate special query operations

### Research Management Capabilities
- Experiment tracking and reproducibility
- Publication preparation and management
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Document version control and organization

## Strategy
- LLM_START.md as entry point for general rules and policies
- Roadmaps for specifications and goals
- Journals for actual project execution
- Generic guidelines and rules for journal maintenance
- All of these are just text or md files

### Future Extensions
- Integration with code or web-based tools
- Specialized templates for different research domains
- Automated analytics for journal content
- Version control specific workflows
